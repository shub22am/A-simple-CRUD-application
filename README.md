# A-simple-CRUD-application
The simple credential GUI application is built using the tkinter and sqlite3 libraries in Python. 
It allows users to create and store their username and password information. The user interface provides input fields for username and password, 
and buttons to save or clear the entries. The application uses the sqlite3 library to create and connect to a database where the user's credentials are stored. 
The status label displays a message indicating whether the credentials were saved successfully or not. 
This simple application can be used as a starting point for building more advanced credential management systems with additional security features.
